**A Multimodal Ship Simulation** for course DT2140 @KTH. 
Last update: 20245-01-12

## Description
### Objective
You, the user, is the captain of a ship, leading them through all obstacles and crises. The ship is divided into two tasks:
1. Navigation - The captain has to navigate the ship through obstacles, being able to steer the ship left or right. However, it isn't guaranteed that you know where the obstacle is. The user will have access to either a **visual** display or sonar **sound** (or both) to guide through the journey.

2. Crisis management - The captain has to guide the crewmates. The status of the rooms in the ship will be displayed on. If there is a crisis, then  you have to move **physical tokens** of your crew to solve these issues!

The objective is to assess the multitasking performance of the user in a high-pressure setting (based on # of task failures and reaction time) using different modalities as feedback.
